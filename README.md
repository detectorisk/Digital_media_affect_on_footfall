# Digital_media_affect_on_footfall
 A client had given me footfall data for a period they ran media. They wanted to understand how media effects footfall, the KPI that they have identified that drives their business forward. 
I have all of my analysis in R. Leveraging the ggplot libraries, along with tidyverse and dplyr, I have tried to study some general trends, best and worst performing stores, among other KPIs. I have also mapped the stores across UK to see the spread and visibility, as well as to see if there are any regional level differences.
